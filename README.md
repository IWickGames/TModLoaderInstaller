# TModLoaderInstaller
Install TModLoader automatically!

Run the softwere and enter your install directory for Terraria. It should be something like SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Terraria .
Make sure there is no \ after Terraria

The softwere will update after every run to download the latest updates for itself and the TModLoader software.
